SwiftObserver is a lightweight framework for reactive Swift. Its design goals make it easy to learn and a joy to use:

1. [**Meaningful Code**](https://github.com/flowtoolz/SwiftObserver/blob/master/Documentation/philosophy.md#meaningful-code) üí°<br>SwiftObserver promotes meaningful metaphors, names and syntax, producing highly readable code.
2. [**Non-intrusive Design**](https://github.com/flowtoolz/SwiftObserver/blob/master/Documentation/philosophy.md#non-intrusive-design) ‚úäüèª<br>SwiftObserver doesn't limit or modulate your design. It just makes it easy to do the right thing.
3. [**Simplicity**](https://github.com/flowtoolz/SwiftObserver/blob/master/Documentation/philosophy.md#simplicity-and-flexibility) üïπ<br>SwiftObserver employs few radically simple concepts and applies them consistently without exceptions.
4. [**Flexibility**](https://github.com/flowtoolz/SwiftObserver/blob/master/Documentation/philosophy.md#simplicity-and-flexibility) ü§∏üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è<br>SwiftObserver's types are simple but universal and composable, making them applicable in many situations.
5. [**Safety**](https://github.com/flowtoolz/SwiftObserver/blob/master/Documentation/philosophy.md#safety) ‚õë<br>SwiftObserver does the memory management for you. Oh yeah, memory leaks are impossible.

SwiftObserver is very few lines of production code, but it's also beyond a 1000 hours of work, thinking it through, letting go of fancy features, documenting it, [unit-testing it](https://github.com/flowtoolz/SwiftObserver/blob/master/Tests/SwiftObserverTests/SwiftObserverTests.swift), and battle-testing it [in practice](http://flowlistapp.com).

## Why the Hell Another Reactive Swift Framework?

[*Reactive Programming*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_programming) adresses the central challenge of implementing effective architectures: controlling dependency direction, in particular making [specific concerns depend on abstract ones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle). SwiftObserver breaks reactive programming down to its essence, which is the [*Observer Pattern*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern).

SwiftObserver diverges from convention as it doesn't inherit the metaphors, terms, types, or function- and operator arsenals of common reactive libraries. It's not as fancy as Rx and Combine and not as restrictive as Redux. Instead, it offers a powerful simplicity you might actually **love** to work with.

# Get Started

## Install

With the [**Swift Package Manager**](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/tree/master/Documentation#swift-package-manager), you can just add the SwiftObserver package [via Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding_package_dependencies_to_your_app) (11+).

Or you manually adjust the [Package.swift](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/blob/master/Documentation/Usage.md#create-a-package) file of your project:

~~~swift
// swift-tools-version:5.1
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "MyApp",
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/flowtoolz/SwiftObserver.git",
                 .upToNextMajor(from: "6.0.0"))
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(name: "MyAppTarget",
                dependencies: ["SwiftObserver"])
    ]
)
~~~

Then run `$ swift build` or `$ swift run`.

With [**Cocoapods**](https://cocoapods.org), adjust your [Podfile](https://guides.cocoapods.org/syntax/podfile.html):

```ruby
target "MyAppTarget" do
  pod "SwiftObserver", "~> 6.0"
end
```

Then run `$ pod install`.

Finally, in your **Swift** files:

```swift
import SwiftObserver
```

## Introduction

No need to learn a bunch of arbitrary metaphors, terms or types.

SwiftObserver is simple: **Objects *observe* other objects**.

Or a tad more technically: ***Observable* objects send *messages* to their *observers***. 

That's it. Just readable code:

~~~swift
dog.observe(Sky.shared) { color in
    // marvel at the sky changing its color
}
~~~

### Observers

Any object can be an `Observer` if it has a `Receiver` for receiving messages:

```swift
class Dog: Observer {
    let receiver = Receiver()
}
```

The receiver retains the observer's observations. The observer just holds on to it strongly.

An  `Observer` may start up to three observations with one combined call:

```swift
dog.observe(tv, bowl, doorbell) { image, food, sound in
    // either the tv's going, I got some food, or the bell rang
}
```

Just starting to observe an `Observable` does **not** trigger it to send a message. This keeps everything simple, predictable and consistent.

And for any message handling closure to be called, its observer must still be alive. There's no awareness after death in memory.

### Observables

Any object can be `Observable` if it has a `Messenger<Message>` for sending messages:

```swift
class Sky: Observable {
    let messenger = Messenger<Color>()
}
```

`Observable` has a function `send(_ message: Message)` for sending messages. Enums often make good `Message` types for custom observables:

~~~swift
class Model: Observable {
    foo() { send(.willUpdate) }
    bar() { send(.didUpdate) }
    deinit { send(.willDie) }
    let messenger = Messenger<Event>()
    enum Event { case willUpdate, didUpdate, willDie }
}
~~~

An `Observable` delivers messages in exactly the order in which they were sent, even when observers, from their message handling closures, somehow cause it to send further messages.

There are four basic ways to create an `Observable`:

1. Make a custom class `Observable` by giving it some `Messenger<Message>`.
2. Create a [`Messenger<Message>`](#messengers). It's an `Observable` through which other entities communicate.
3. Create a [`Variable<Value>`](#variables) (a.k.a. `Var<Value>`). It holds a value and sends value updates.
4. Create a [*transform*](#make-transforms-observable) object. It wraps and transforms another observable.

### Memory Management

When observers or observables die, SwiftObserver cleans up related observations automatically, making memory leaks impossible. So there isn't really any memory management to worry about.

However, you can manually stop an observer's observations:

```swift
dog.stopObserving(Sky.shared)  // no more messages from the sky
dog.stopObserving()            // no more messages at all
```

# Messengers

`Messenger` is the simplest `Observable` and the basis of every other `Observable`. It doesn't send messages by itself but anyone can send messages through it, and use it for any type of message:

```swift
let messenger = Messenger<String>()

observer.observe(messenger) { message in
    // respond to message
}

messenger.send("my message")
```

`Messenger` embodies the common [messenger / notifier pattern](Documentation/specific-patterns.md#the-messenger-pattern) and can be used for that out of the box. 

Having a messenger is actually what defines and object as being `Observable`:

```swift
public protocol Observable: class {
    var messenger: Messenger<Message> { get }
    associatedtype Message: Any
}
```

`Messenger` is itself `Observable` because it points to itself as the required `Messenger`:

```swift
extension Messenger: Observable {
    public var messenger: Messenger<Message> { self }
}
```

# Variables

 `Var<Value>` is an `Observable` that has a property `value: Value`. 

## Observe Variables

Whenever its `value` changes, `Var<Value>` sends a *message* of type `Update<Value>`, informing about the `old` and `new` value:

~~~swift
let number = Var(42)

observer.observe(number) { update in
    let whatsTheBigDifference = update.new - update.old
}
~~~

In addition, you can always manually call `variable.send()` (without argument) to send an update in which `old` and `new` both hold the current `value` (see [`BufferedObservable`](#message-buffering)).

## Use Variable Values

`Value` must be `Equatable`, and based on its `value` the whole `Var<Value>` is `Equatable`.  Where `Value` is `Comparable`, `Var<Value>` will also be `Comparable`.

You can set `value` via initializer, directly and via the `<-` operator:

~~~swift
let text = Var<String?>()    // text.value == nil
text.value = "a text"
let number = Var(23)         // number.value == 23
number <- 42                 // number.value == 42
~~~

### Number Values

If `Value` is some number type `Number` that is either an `Int`, `Float` or `Double`:

1. Every `Var<Number>`, `Var<Number?>`, `Var<Number>?` and `Var<Number?>?` has a respective property `var int: Int`, `var float: Float` or `var double: Double`. That property is non-optional and interprets `nil` values as zero.

2. You can apply numeric operators `+`, `-`, `*` and `/` to all pairs of `Number`, `Number?`, `Var<Number>`, `Var<Number?>`, `Var<Number>?` and `Var<Number?>?`.

```swift
let numVar = Var<Int?>()     // numVar.value == nil
print(numVar.int)            // 0
numVar.int += 5              // numVar.value == 5
numVar <- Var(1) + 2         // numVar.value == 3
```

### String Values

1. Every `Var<String>`, `Var<String?>`, `Var<String>?` and `Var<String?>?` has a property `var string: String`. That property is non-optional and interprets `nil` values as `""`.
3. You can apply concatenation operator `+` to all pairs of `String`, `String?`, `Var<String>`, `Var<String?>`, `Var<String>?` and `Var<String?>?`.
3. Representing its `string` property, every `Var<String>` and `Var<String?>` conforms to `TextOutputStream`, `BidirectionalCollection`, `Collection`, `Sequence`, `CustomDebugStringConvertible` and `CustomStringConvertible`.

## Encode and Decode Variables

Every `Var<Value>` is `Codable` and requires its `Value` to be `Codable`. So when one of your types has `Var` properties, you can still make that type `Codable` by simply adopting the `Codable` protocol:

~~~swift
class Model: Codable {
    private(set) var text = Var("String Variable")
}
~~~

Note that `text` is a `var` instead of a `let`. It cannot be constant because Swift's implicit decoder must mutate it. However, clients of `Model` would be supposed to set only `text.value` and not `text` itself, so the setter is private.

# Authors

Every message has an author associated with it. This feature is only explicit in code if you use it.

An observable can send an author together with a message via `observable.send(message, from: author)`. If noone specifies an author as in `observable.send(message)`, the observable itself becomes the author.

The observer can receive the author, by adding it as an argument to the message handling closure:

```swift
observer.observe(observable) { message, author in
    // process message from author
}
```

Explicating authors enables observers to determine a message's origin, in particular to identify a change author or message sender:

```swift
class SomeEntity: Observer {
    func init() {
        observe(messenger) { message, author in
            if author === self {
                // i'm the author of this message. no reaction necessary.
            }
        }
    }
  
    func foo() {
        messenger.send("some message", from: self) // set custom message author
    }
  
    let receiver = Receiver()
}

let messenger = Messenger<String>()
```

Variables have a special value setter that allows to identify change authors:

```swift
let number = Var(0)
number.set(42, as: observer) // observer will be author of the update message
```

# Transforms

Transforms make common steps of message processing more succinct and readable. They allow to map, filter and unwrap messages in many ways. You may freely chain these transforms together and also define new ones with them.

This example transforms messages of type `Update<String?>` into ones of type `Int`:

```swift
let title = Var<String?>()

observer.observe(title).new().unwrap("Untitled").map({ $0.count }) { titleLength in
    // do something with the new title length
}
```

## Make Transforms Observable

You may transform a particular observation directly on the fly, like in the above example. Such ad hoc transforms give the observer lots of flexibility.

Or you may instantiate a new `Observable` that has the transform chain baked into it. The above example could then look like this:

```swift
let title = Var<String?>()
let titleLength = title.new().unwrap("Untitled").map { $0.count }

observer.observe(titleLength) { titleLength in
    // do something with the new title length
}
```

Such stand-alone transforms can offer the same preprocessing to multiple observers. But since these transforms are distinct `Observable` objects, you must hold them strongly somewhere. Holding transforms as dedicated observable objects suits entities like view models that represent transformations of other data.

## Use Prebuilt Transforms

Whether you apply transforms ad hoc or as stand-alone objects, they work the same way. The following list of available transforms illustrates them mostly as observable objects.

### Map

First, there is your regular familiar `map` function. It transforms messages and often also their type:

```swift
let messenger = Messenger<String>()          // sends String
let stringToInt = messenger.map { Int($0) }  // sends Int?
```

### New

When an `Observable` like a `Var<Value>` sends *messages* of type `Update<Value>`, we often only care about  the `new` value, so we map the update with `new()`:

~~~swift
let errorCode = Var<Int>()          // sends Update<Int>
let newErrorCode = errorCode.new()  // sends Int
~~~

### Filter

When you want to receive only certain messages, use `filter`:

```swift
let messenger = Messenger<String>()                     // sends String
let shortMessages = messenger.filter { $0.count < 10 }  // sends String if length < 10
```

### Select

Use `select` to receive only one specific message. `select` works with all `Equatable` message types. `select` maps the message type onto `Void`, so a receiving closure after a selection takes no message argument:

```swift
let messenger = Messenger<String>()                   // sends String
let myNotifier = messenger.select("my notification")  // sends Void (no messages)

observer.observe(myNotifier) {                        // no argument
    // someone sent "my notification"
}
```

### Unwrap

Sometimes, we make message types optional, for example when there is no meaningful initial value for a `Var`. But we often don't want to deal with optionals down the line. So we can use `unwrap()`, suppressing `nil` messages entirely:

~~~swift
let errorCodes = Messenger<Int?>()     // sends Int?       
let errorAlert = errorCodes.unwrap()   // sends Int if the message is not nil
~~~

### Unwrap with Default

You may also unwrap optional messages by replacing `nil` values with a default:

~~~swift
let points = Messenger<Int?>()         // sends Int?       
let pointsToShow = points.unwrap(0)    // sends Int with 0 for nil
~~~

### Filter Author

Filter authors the same way you filter messages:

```swift
let messenger = Messenger<String>()            // sends String

let friendMessages = messenger.filterAuthor {  // sends String if message is from friend
    friends.contains($0)
} 
```

### From

If only one specific author is of interest, filter authors with `from`:

```swift
let messenger = Messenger<String>()     // sends String
let joesMessages = messenger.from(joe)  // sends String if message is from joe
```

### Not From

If **all but one** specific author are of interest, suppress messages from that author via `notFrom`:

```swift
class Collaborator {
    init() {
        observe(sharedText).notFrom(self) { update in
            // some one else edited the text
        }
    }
  
    func foo() {
        sharedText.set("my new text", as: self)
    }
}

let sharedText = Var<String>()  // sends messages of type Update<String>
```

Excluding one author is particularly useful when multiple entities observe and change shared data. Those entities would only care about the changes that others made, so they would all identify themselves as change authors when they modify the data, and they would exclude themselves as authors when they observe the data.

## Chain Transforms

You may chain transforms together:

```swift
let numbers = Messenger<Int>()

observer.observe(numbers).map {
    "\($0)"                      // Int -> String
}.filter {
    $0.count > 1                 // suppress single digit integers
}.map {
    Int.init($0)                 // String -> Int?
}.unwrap {                       // Int? -> Int
    print($0)                    // receive and process resulting Int
}
```

Of course, ad hoc transforms like the above end on the actual message handling closure. Now, when the last transform in the chain also takes a closure argument for its processing, like `map` and `filter` do, we use `receive` to stick with the nice syntax of [trailing closures](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Closures.html#ID102):

~~~swift
dog.observe(Sky.shared).map {
    $0 == .blue     
}.receive {
    print("Will we go outside? \($0 ? "Yes" : "No")!")
} 
~~~

# Advanced Observables

## Message Buffering

A `BufferedObservable` is an `Observable` that also has a property `latestMessage: Message` which typically returns the last sent message or one that indicates that nothing has changed. `BufferedObservable` has a `func send()` that takes no argument and sends `latestMessage`.

Only `BufferedObservable`s can be part of combined observations like this:

```swift
observer.observe(observable1, observable2) { message1, message2 in 
    // one of the observables sent a message, but we receive both messages
}
```

When one of the combined observables sends a message, the combined observation **pulls** messages from the other observables to provide all latest messages to the observer (read more on this design [here](Documentation/philosophy.md#the-philosophy-of-swiftobserver)).


 There are three kinds of buffered observables:

1. Any `Var` is buffered. Its `latestMessage` is an `Update` in which `old` and `new` are both the current `value`.

2. Any observable transform that has a buffered source observable is itself buffered **if** it never suppresses (filters) messages. The `latestMessage` of a buffered transform returns the transformed `latestMessage` of its source. 

   Obviously, a filter, by definition, can't guarantee to output anything for every message from its source. Transforms that do filter messages are: `filter`, `unwrap()` (without default) and `select`. 

3. Any of your custom observables is buffered **if** you make it conform to `BufferedObservable`. This is easy. Even if the message type isn't based on some state, you can still return a meaningful default value as `latestMessage` or make the message type optional and just return `nil`.

## State Updates

To implement an `Observable` like `Var<Value>` that sends value updates, you would use the message type  `Update<Value>`. If you also want to involve the observable in combined observations, you make it a `BufferedObservable` and let `latestMessage` return a message based on the latest (current) value:

~~~swift
class Model: BufferedObservable {
    var latestMessage: Update<String> {
        Update(state, state)
    }
  
    var state: String = "" {
        didSet {
            if state != oldValue {
                send(Update(oldValue, state))
            }
        }
    }
  
    let messenger = Messenger<Update<String>>()
}
~~~

## Weak Reference

When you want to put an `Observable` into some data structure or as the *source* into a *transform* but hold it there as a `weak` reference, you may want to wrap it in `Weak<O: Observable>`:

~~~swift
let number = Var(12)
let weakNumber = Weak(number)

observer.observe(weakNumber) { update in
    // process update of type Update<Int>
}

var weakNumbers = [Weak<Var<Int>>]()
weakNumbers.append(weakNumber)
~~~

`Weak<O: Observable>` is itself an `Observable` and functions as a complete substitute for its wrapped `weak` `Observable`, which you can access via the `observable` property:

~~~swift
let numberIsAlive = weakNumber.observable != nil
let numberValue = weakNumber.observable?.value
~~~

`Weak` isn't buffered and doesn't duplicate any messages. It would be easy to implement a class `BufferedWeak` that wraps a `BufferedObservable` weakly. If you like to see that, maybe even just for consistency/completeness, let me know.
