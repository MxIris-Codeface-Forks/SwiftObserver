# SwiftObserver

[![badge-pod]](http://cocoapods.org/pods/SwiftObserver) ![badge-pms] ![badge-languages] [![badge-gitter]](https://gitter.im/flowtoolz/SwiftObserver?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge) ![badge-platforms] ![badge-mit]

SwiftObserver is a lightweight framework for reactive Swift. Its design goals make it easy to learn and a joy to use:

1. [**Meaningful Code**](https://github.com/flowtoolz/SwiftObserver/blob/master/Documentation/philosophy.md#meaningful-code) üí°<br>SwiftObserver promotes meaningful metaphors, names and syntax, producing highly readable code.
2. [**Non-intrusive Design**](https://github.com/flowtoolz/SwiftObserver/blob/master/Documentation/philosophy.md#non-intrusive-design) ‚úäüèª<br>SwiftObserver doesn't limit or modulate your design. It just makes it easy to do the right thing.
3. [**Simplicity**](https://github.com/flowtoolz/SwiftObserver/blob/master/Documentation/philosophy.md#simplicity-and-flexibility) üïπ<br>SwiftObserver employs few radically simple concepts and applies them consistently without exceptions.
4. [**Flexibility**](https://github.com/flowtoolz/SwiftObserver/blob/master/Documentation/philosophy.md#simplicity-and-flexibility) ü§∏üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è<br>SwiftObserver's types are simple but universal and composable, making them applicable in many situations.
5. [**Safety**](https://github.com/flowtoolz/SwiftObserver/blob/master/Documentation/philosophy.md#safety) ‚õë<br>SwiftObserver does the memory management for you. Oh yeah, memory leaks are impossible.

SwiftObserver is just 1600 lines of production code, but it's well beyond a 1000 hours of work, rethinking and reworking it, letting go of fancy features, documenting it, [unit-testing it](https://github.com/flowtoolz/SwiftObserver/tree/master/Tests/SwiftObserverTests), and battle-testing it [in practice](http://flowlistapp.com).

## Why the Hell Another Reactive Swift Framework?

[*Reactive Programming*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_programming) adresses the central challenge of implementing effective architectures: controlling dependency direction, in particular making [specific concerns depend on abstract ones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle). SwiftObserver breaks reactive programming down to its essence, which is the [*Observer Pattern*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern).

SwiftObserver diverges from convention as it doesn't inherit the metaphors, terms, types, or function- and operator arsenals of common reactive libraries. It's not as fancy as Rx and Combine and not as restrictive as Redux. Instead, it offers a powerful simplicity you might actually **love** to work with.

# Get Started

## Install

With the [**Swift Package Manager**](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/tree/master/Documentation#swift-package-manager), you can just add the SwiftObserver package [via Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding_package_dependencies_to_your_app) (11+).

Or you manually adjust the [Package.swift](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/blob/master/Documentation/Usage.md#create-a-package) file of your project:

~~~swift
// swift-tools-version:5.1
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "MyApp",
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/flowtoolz/SwiftObserver.git",
                 .upToNextMajor(from: "6.0.0"))
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(name: "MyAppTarget",
                dependencies: ["SwiftObserver"])
    ]
)
~~~

Then run `$ swift build` or `$ swift run`.

With [**Cocoapods**](https://cocoapods.org), adjust your [Podfile](https://guides.cocoapods.org/syntax/podfile.html):

```ruby
target "MyAppTarget" do
  pod "SwiftObserver", "~> 6.0"
end
```

Then run `$ pod install`.

Finally, in your **Swift** files:

```swift
import SwiftObserver
```

## Introduction

No need to learn a bunch of arbitrary metaphors, terms or types.

SwiftObserver is simple: **Objects *observe* other objects**.

Or a tad more technically: ***Observables* send *messages* to their *observers***.

That's it. Just readable code:

~~~swift
dog.observe(Sky.shared) { color in
    // marvel at the sky changing its color
}
~~~

### Observers

Any object can be an `Observer` if it has a `Receiver` for receiving messages:

```swift
class Dog: Observer {
    let receiver = Receiver()
}
```

The receiver retains the observer's observations. The observer just holds on to it strongly.

#### Notes on Observers

* For a message receiving closure to be called, the `Observer` must still be alive. There's no awareness after death in memory.
* An `Observer` can do multiple simultaneous observations of the same `Observable`, starting each via the mentioned `observe(...)` function.
* You can check wether an observer is observing an observable via `observer.isObserving(observable)`.

#### Free Observers

You don't even need an explicit observer to start an observation:

~~~swift
observe(Sky.shared) { color in
    // marvel at the sky changing its color
}

Sky.shared.observed { color in
    // ...
}
~~~

The above examples internally call `FreeObserver.shared.observe(...)`.

You can also instantiate your own `FreeObserver` to do observations even more "freely". Just remember to keep the observer alive as long as the observation shall last.

And you can do one-time observations via `observeOnce(observable) { ... }` and  `observable.observedOnce { ... }`. Both return the involved `FreeObserver` as a discardable result. But typically you ignore that observer since it will die together with its observation as soon as the observable has sent a first message.

### Observables

Any object can be `Observable` if it has a `Messenger<Message>` for sending messages:

```swift
class Sky: Observable {
    let messenger = Messenger<Color>()  // Message of type Color
}
```

#### Notes on Observables

* An `Observable` sends messages via `send(_ message: Message)`. The observable's clients, even its observers, are also free to call that function. 
* An `Observable` delivers messages in exactly the order in which `send(...)` is called, which helps when observers, from their message handling closures, somehow trigger further `send` calls.
* Just starting to observe an `Observable` does **not** trigger it to send a message. This keeps everything simple, predictable and consistent.

#### Ways to Create an Observable

1. Create a [`Messenger<Message>`](#messengers). It's a mediator through which other entities communicate.
2. Create an object of a [custom `Observable`](#messengers) class that utilizes `Messenger<Message>`.
3. Create a [`Promise<Value>`](#promises). It's a Messenger with conveniences for asynchronous returns.
4. Create a [`Variable<Value>`](#variables) (a.k.a. `Var<Value>`). It holds a value and sends value updates.
5. Create a [*transform*](#make-transforms-observable) object. It wraps and transforms another `Observable`.

### Memory Management

When observers or observables die, SwiftObserver cleans up the related observations automatically, making memory leaks impossible. So there isn't really any memory management to worry about.

However, observers and observables can stop particular- or all their ongoing observations:

```swift
dog.stopObserving(Sky.shared)          // no more messages from the sky
dog.stopObserving()                    // no more messages from anywhere
Sky.shared.stopBeingObserved(by: dog)  // no more messages to dog
Sky.shared.stopBeingObserved()         // no more messages to anywhere
```

You may involve `FreeObserver.shared` to stop certain or all free global observations.

# Messengers

`Messenger` is the simplest `Observable` and the basis of every other `Observable`. It doesn't send messages by itself but anyone can send messages through it and use it for any type of message:

```swift
let textMessenger = Messenger<String>()

observer.observe(textMessenger) { textMessage in
    // respond to textMessage
}

textMessenger.send("my message")
```

`Messenger` embodies the common [messenger / notifier pattern](Documentation/specific-patterns.md#the-messenger-pattern) and can be used for that out of the box. 

Having a messenger is actually what defines `Observable` objects:

```swift
public protocol Observable: class {
    var messenger: Messenger<Message> { get }
    associatedtype Message: Any
}
```

`Messenger` is itself `Observable` because it points to itself as the required `Messenger`:

```swift
extension Messenger: Observable {
    public var messenger: Messenger<Message> { self }
}
```

All other observables are either subclasses of `Messenger` or custom observables that provide some `Messenger<Message>`. Custom observables often employ some `enum` as their `Message` type:

~~~swift
class Model: Observable {
    foo() { send(.willUpdate) }
    bar() { send(.didUpdate) }
    deinit { send(.willDie) }
    let messenger = Messenger<Event>()
    enum Event { case willUpdate, didUpdate, willDie }
}
~~~

# Promises

`Promise<Value>` is a `Messenger<Value>` that offers a simple promise implementation. It helps with managing and chaining asynchronous calls.

> **Side Note:** `Promise` is part of SwiftObserver because [Combine's `Future`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/future) is unfortunately not a practical solution for one-shot asynchronous calls, to depend on [PromiseKit](https://github.com/mxcl/PromiseKit) might be unnecessary in reasonably simple contexts, and [Vapor/NIO's Async](https://docs.vapor.codes/4.0/async/) might also be too server-specific. Anyway, integrating promises as regular observables yields some consistency, simplicity and synergy here. However, at some point *all* promise/future implementations will be obsolete due to [Swift's async/await](https://github.com/DougGregor/swift-evolution/blob/async-await/proposals/nnnn-async-await.md).

## Receive a Promised Value

```swift
func getID() -> Promise<Int> {   // getID() promises an Int
    Promise { promise in         // convenience initializer
        getIDAsync { id in       // handler retains the promise until it's fulfilled
            promise.fulfill(id)  // equivalent to promise.send(id)
        } 
    }
}

getID().observed { id in         // observation by FreeObserver.shared
    // do somethin with the ID
}
```

Typically, promises are shortlived observables that you don't store anywhere. That works fine since an asynchronous function returning a promise (like `getID()`) keeps that promise alive in order to fulfill it. So you can (globally) observe such a promise without even storing it, and the promise as well as its observations get cleaned up automatically when the promise is fulfilled and dies.

## Receive a Promised Value Again

Sometimes, you want to do multiple things with an asynchronous result (long) after receiving it. In that case you may keep a [buffer of the promise](#buffered-observables), so its value will be stored:

```swift
let bufferedIDPromise = getID().buffer()  // a BufferedObservable

bufferedIDPromise.whenFulfilled { id in   // gets id from buffer or from observation
    // do somethin with the ID
}

bufferedIDPromise.whenFulfilled { id in
    // do somethin else with the ID
}
```

The function `whenFulfilled` is available on all [buffered observables](#buffered-observables) that have an optional message type. It provides an unwrapped message as soon as one is available. If the buffer's `latestMessage` is still `nil`, `whenFulfilled` starts a one-time observation of the buffer.

If you hold on to a `Promise` directly, its observations still get cleaned up, since a `Promise` actively stops being observed after the first time it sends a message or gets fulfilled. In the above example this just means that the buffer stops observing its underlying promise as soon as the promise was fulfilled.

## Chain Observables

Inspired by PromiseKit, SwiftObserver allows to create promises by chaining observables:

```swift
first {                         
    promiseInt()                // return Promise<Int>
}.then {
    promiseString(takeInt: $0)  // take Int sent by observable 'first', return Promise<String>
}.observed {                    // observation dies when promise 'then' is fulfilled
    print($0)                   // print String sent by promise 'then'
}
```

`first` is only for readability. It takes a closure that returns an `Observable` and just returns that `Observable`.

You call `then` on a "source" `Observable`, and pass it a closure that returns a "target" `Observable`. It provides the next message from the "source" to the closure that returns the target, allowing the target to process the source message. `then` basically combines source and target into a new `Promise<TargetMessage>`.

Of course, this is geared towards combining promises into new promises, but the closures you pass to `first` and `then` can return any type of `Observable`s.


# Variables

 `Var<Value>` is an `Observable` that has a property `value: Value`. 

## Observe Variables

Whenever its `value` changes, `Var<Value>` sends a *message* of type `Update<Value>`, informing about the `old` and `new` value:

~~~swift
let number = Var(42)

observer.observe(number) { update in
    let whatsTheBigDifference = update.new - update.old
}
~~~

In addition, you can always manually call `variable.send()` (without argument) to send an update in which `old` and `new` both hold the current `value` (see [`BufferedObservable`](#message-buffering)).

## Use Variable Values

`Value` must be `Equatable`, and based on its `value` the whole `Var<Value>` is `Equatable`.  Where `Value` is `Comparable`, `Var<Value>` will also be `Comparable`.

You can set `value` via initializer, directly and via the `<-` operator:

~~~swift
let text = Var<String?>()    // text.value == nil
text.value = "a text"
let number = Var(23)         // number.value == 23
number <- 42                 // number.value == 42
~~~

### Number Values

If `Value` is some number type `Number` that is either an `Int`, `Float` or `Double`:

1. Every `Var<Number>`, `Var<Number?>`, `Var<Number>?` and `Var<Number?>?` has a respective property `var int: Int`, `var float: Float` or `var double: Double`. That property is non-optional and interprets `nil` values as zero.

2. You can apply numeric operators `+`, `-`, `*` and `/` to all pairs of `Number`, `Number?`, `Var<Number>`, `Var<Number?>`, `Var<Number>?` and `Var<Number?>?`.

```swift
let numVar = Var<Int?>()     // numVar.value == nil
print(numVar.int)            // 0
numVar.int += 5              // numVar.value == 5
numVar <- Var(1) + 2         // numVar.value == 3
```

### String Values

1. Every `Var<String>`, `Var<String?>`, `Var<String>?` and `Var<String?>?` has a property `var string: String`. That property is non-optional and interprets `nil` values as `""`.
3. You can apply concatenation operator `+` to all pairs of `String`, `String?`, `Var<String>`, `Var<String?>`, `Var<String>?` and `Var<String?>?`.
3. Representing its `string` property, every `Var<String>` and `Var<String?>` conforms to `TextOutputStream`, `BidirectionalCollection`, `Collection`, `Sequence`, `CustomDebugStringConvertible` and `CustomStringConvertible`.

## Encode and Decode Variables

Every `Var<Value>` is `Codable` and requires its `Value` to be `Codable`. So when one of your types has `Var` properties, you can still make that type `Codable` by simply adopting the `Codable` protocol:

~~~swift
class Model: Codable {
    private(set) var text = Var("String Variable")
}
~~~

Note that `text` is a `var` instead of a `let`. It cannot be constant because Swift's implicit decoder must mutate it. However, clients of `Model` would be supposed to set only `text.value` and not `text` itself, so the setter is private.


# Transforms

Transforms make common steps of message processing more succinct and readable. They allow to map, filter and unwrap messages in many ways. You may freely chain these transforms together and also define new ones with them.

This example transforms messages of type `Update<String?>` into ones of type `Int`:

```swift
let title = Var<String?>()

observer.observe(title).new().unwrap("Untitled").map({ $0.count }) { titleLength in
    // do something with the new title length
}
```

## Make Transforms Observable

You may transform a particular observation directly on the fly, like in the above example. Such ad hoc transforms give the observer lots of flexibility.

Or you may instantiate a new `Observable` that has the transform chain baked into it. The above example could then look like this:

```swift
let title = Var<String?>()
let titleLength = title.new().unwrap("Untitled").map { $0.count }

observer.observe(titleLength) { titleLength in
    // do something with the new title length
}
```

Such stand-alone transforms can offer the same preprocessing to multiple observers. But since these transforms are distinct `Observable` objects, you must hold them strongly somewhere. Holding transforms as dedicated observable objects suits entities like view models that represent transformations of other data.

## Use Prebuilt Transforms

Whether you apply transforms ad hoc or as stand-alone objects, they work the same way. The following list illustrates prebuilt transforms as observable objects.

### Map

First, there is your regular familiar `map` function. It transforms messages and often also their type:

```swift
let messenger = Messenger<String>()          // sends String
let stringToInt = messenger.map { Int($0) }  // sends Int?
```

### New

When an `Observable` like a `Var<Value>` sends *messages* of type `Update<Value>`, we often only care about  the `new` value, so we map the update with `new()`:

~~~swift
let errorCode = Var<Int>()          // sends Update<Int>
let newErrorCode = errorCode.new()  // sends Int
~~~

### Filter

When you want to receive only certain messages, use `filter`:

```swift
let messenger = Messenger<String>()                     // sends String
let shortMessages = messenger.filter { $0.count < 10 }  // sends String if length < 10
```

### Select

Use `select` to receive only one specific message. `select` works with all `Equatable` message types. `select` maps the message type onto `Void`, so a receiving closure after a selection takes no message argument:

```swift
let messenger = Messenger<String>()                   // sends String
let myNotifier = messenger.select("my notification")  // sends Void (no messages)

observer.observe(myNotifier) {                        // no argument
    // someone sent "my notification"
}
```

### Unwrap

Sometimes, we make message types optional, for example when there is no meaningful initial value for a `Var`. But we often don't want to deal with optionals down the line. So we can use `unwrap()`, suppressing `nil` messages entirely:

~~~swift
let errorCodes = Messenger<Int?>()     // sends Int?       
let errorAlert = errorCodes.unwrap()   // sends Int if the message is not nil
~~~

### Unwrap with Default

You may also unwrap optional messages by replacing `nil` values with a default:

~~~swift
let points = Messenger<Int?>()         // sends Int?       
let pointsToShow = points.unwrap(0)    // sends Int with 0 for nil
~~~

## Chain Transforms

You may chain transforms together:

```swift
let numbers = Messenger<Int>()

observer.observe(numbers).map {
    "\($0)"                      // Int -> String
}.filter {
    $0.count > 1                 // suppress single digit integers
}.map {
    Int.init($0)                 // String -> Int?
}.unwrap {                       // Int? -> Int
    print($0)                    // receive and process resulting Int
}
```

Of course, ad hoc transforms like the above end on the actual message handling closure. Now, when the last transform in the chain also takes a closure argument for its processing, like `map` and `filter` do, we use `receive` to stick with the nice syntax of [trailing closures](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Closures.html#ID102):

~~~swift
dog.observe(Sky.shared).map {
    $0 == .blue     
}.receive {
    print("Will we go outside? \($0 ? "Yes" : "No")!")
} 
~~~

# Advanced Stuff

## Authors

Every message has an author associated with it. This feature is only noticable in code if you use it.

An observable can send an author together with a message via `observable.send(message, from: author)`. If noone specifies an author as in `observable.send(message)`, the observable itself becomes the author.

### Authors of Variable Updates

Variables have a special value setter that allows to identify change authors:

```swift
let number = Var(0)
number.set(42, as: controller) // controller will be the author of the update message
```

### Observing Authors

The observer can receive the author, by adding it as an argument to the message handling closure:

```swift
observer.observe(observable) { message, author in
    // process message from author
}
```

Through the author, observers can determine a message's origin. This is a useful addition to the plain messenger pattern, where it allows observers to identify message senders.

### Shared Mutable Data

Identifying authors becomes essential with all sorts of storage abstractions and caching hierarchies, where it allows observers to identify the change authors of data modifications:

```swift
class Collaborator: Observer {
    func observeText() {
        observe(sharedText) { update, author in
            guard author !== self else { return }
            // someone else edited the text
        }
    }
  
    func editText() {
        sharedText.set("my new text", as: self) // identify as author when editing
    }
  
    let receiver = Receiver()
}

let sharedText = Var<String>()
```

Ignoring messages from `self` is typical when multiple entities observe and mutate shared data. An entity would only care about the modifications that others made, so it would identify itself as change author when modifying the data, and only process messages that are not from `self` when observing the data.

### Author Related Transforms

There are three transforms related to message authors. As with other transforms, you can apply them directly in observations or create them as standalone observables.

#### Filter Author

Filter authors the same way you filter messages:

```swift
let messenger = Messenger<String>()            // sends String

let friendMessages = messenger.filterAuthor {  // sends String if message is from friend
    friends.contains($0)
} 
```

#### From

If only one specific author is of interest, filter authors with `from`:

```swift
let messenger = Messenger<String>()     // sends String
let joesMessages = messenger.from(joe)  // sends String if message is from joe
```

#### Not From

If **all but one** specific author are of interest, suppress messages from that author via `notFrom`:

```swift
let messenger = Messenger<String>()             // sends String
let humanMessages = messenger.notFrom(hal9000)  // sends String, but not from an evil AI
```

## Buffered Observables 

A `BufferedObservable` is an `Observable` that also has a property `latestMessage: Message` which typically returns the last sent message or one that indicates that nothing has changed. `BufferedObservable` has a `func send()` that takes no argument and sends `latestMessage`.

### Combined Observation

Only `BufferedObservable`s can be part of combined observations like this:

```swift
dog.observe(tv, bowl, doorbell) { image, food, sound in
    // either the tv's going, I got some food, or the bell rang
}
```

When one of the combined observables sends a message, the combined observation **pulls** messages from the other observables to provide all latest messages to the observer (read more on this design [here](Documentation/philosophy.md#the-philosophy-of-swiftobserver)).

### Four Kinds of Buffered Observables

1. Any `Var` is buffered. Its `latestMessage` is an `Update` in which `old` and `new` both hold the current `value`.

2. Calling `buffer()` on an `Observable` creates a `BufferedObservable`. The resulting buffered observable's `Message` will be optional but never a doubled optional, even if the original observable's `Message` is optional. This is the only transform that only works as a distinct observable object.

3. Any observable transform that has a buffered source observable is itself buffered **if** it never suppresses (filters) messages. These transforms are: `map`, `new` and `unwrap(default)`.

   Be aware that the `latestMessage` of such a transform only ever returns the transformed `latestMessage` of its underlying buffered source. Calling `send(transformedMessage)` on the transform object itself will not "update" its `latestMessage`.

4. Any of your custom observables is buffered **if** you make it conform to `BufferedObservable`. This is easy. Even if the message type isn't based on some state, you can still return a meaningful default value as `latestMessage` or make the message type optional and return `nil`.

### Buffered Value Updates

To implement an `Observable` like `Var<Value>` that sends value updates, you would use the message type  `Update<Value>`. If you also want to involve the observable in combined observations, you make it a `BufferedObservable` and let `latestMessage` return a message based on the latest (current) value:

~~~swift
class Model: BufferedObservable {
    var latestMessage: Update<String> {
        Update(state, state)
    }
  
    var state: String = "" {
        didSet {
            if state != oldValue {
                send(Update(oldValue, state))
            }
        }
    }
  
    let messenger = Messenger<Update<String>>()
}
~~~

## Weak Reference

When you want to put an `Observable` into some data structure or as the *source* into a *transform* but hold it there as a `weak` reference, you may want to wrap it in `Weak<O: Observable>`:

~~~swift
let number = Var(12)
let weakNumber = Weak(number)

observer.observe(weakNumber) { update in
    // process update of type Update<Int>
}

var weakNumbers = [Weak<Var<Int>>]()
weakNumbers.append(weakNumber)
~~~

`Weak<O: Observable>` is itself an `Observable` and functions as a complete substitute for its wrapped `weak` `Observable`, which you can access via the `observable` property:

~~~swift
let numberIsAlive = weakNumber.observable != nil
let numberValue = weakNumber.observable?.value
~~~
