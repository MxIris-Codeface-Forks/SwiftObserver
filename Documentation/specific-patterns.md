# Specific Patterns

This document describes a few patterns that emerged from usage.

In general, SwiftObserver meets almost all needs for callbacks and continuous propagation of data up the control hierarchy (against the direction of control). Typical applications are the propagation of data from domain model to use cases, from use cases to view models, from view models to views, and from views to view controllers.

## Messenger

When observer and observable need to be more decoupled, it is common to use a mediating observable through which any object can anonymously send updates. An example of this mediator is `Foundation`'s `NotificationCenter`.

This extension of the *Observer Pattern* is sometimes called *Messenger*, *Notifier*, *Dispatcher*, *Event Emitter* or *Decoupler*. Its main differences to direct observation are:

- An observer may indirectly observe multiple other objects.
- Observers don't care who triggered an update.
- Observer types don't need to depend on the types that trigger updates.
- Updates function more as messages (notifications, events) than as artifacts of raw data.
- Every object can trigger updates, without adopting any protocol.
- Multiple objects may share the same update type and trigger the same updates.

You can simply use a (mapped) `Variable` as a mediating messenger:

~~~swift
let textMessenger = Var<String>().new()

observer.observe(textMessenger) { textMessage in
    // respond to text message
}
    
textMessenger.send("some message")
~~~
    
An `Observer` can use the select filter to observe one specific message:

~~~swift
observer.observe(textMessenger).select("event name") {
    // respond to "event name"
}
~~~
    
Of course, you can access the latest message through the messenger's source:

~~~swift
let latestMessage = textMessenger.source.new
~~~

## Owned Messenger

An *Owned Messenger* is a helpful, and sometimes necessary, application of the *Messenger* pattern.

Instead of making a class `C` directly observable you give it an observable messenger as a constant. `C` sends its updates via its messenger, and observers of `C` actually observe the messenger of `C`. We recommend using a `Variable` for this:

~~~swift
class C {
   let messenger = Var<Event>()
}
~~~

And why would you want that? An *Owned Messenger* is necessary in three scenarios ...

### 1. Require Specific Observability in an Interface

We want to declare a variable or constant as conforming to an interface (let's say `Database`) specifying (among other functionality) observability with a specific update type (say `DatabaseUpdate`).

#### Challenge

We don't want to define an abstract base class because objects conforming to the interface should be able to derive from their own (and more meaningful) class (like `ICloudDatabase`).

Now, we would want to define a protocol like this:

~~~swift
protocol Database: Observable where UpdateType == DatabaseUpdate {
   // declare other database functionality
}
~~~

But this protocol could only be used as a generic constraint because it has an associated type requirement (Swift doesn't have generalized existentials yet).

We can't declare a variable or constant of the protocol type `Database`, like we are used to with delegate protocols:

~~~swift
weak var delegate: MyDelegateProtocol
// ^^ perfectly fine

var database: Database
// ^^ compiler error: Protocol 'Database' can only be used as a generic constraint because it has Self or associated type requirements
~~~

#### Solution

We use a `Database` protocol but without a `where` clause. Instead, we require the `Database` to have it own messenger: 

~~~swift
protocol Database {
   var messenger: Var<DatabaseUpdate> { get }
   // declare other database functionality
}
~~~

Now, we must route all observation of the database through its messenger, but at least it works.

### 2. Observe Apple Classes that Can't be Referenced Weakly

There are a number of classes from Apple's frameworks that [cannot be referenced weakly](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/releasenotes/ObjectiveC/RN-TransitioningToARC/Introduction/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40011226-CH1-SW17). Among them are `NSMenuView`, `NSFont` and `NSTextView`.

When we create a custom `NSTextView` and try to observe it, we get a runtime error:

~~~swift
class MyTextView: NSTextView: Observable {
   var latestUpdate = TextEvent.none
}

let textView = MyTextView()

observe(textView) { textEvent in
   // process event
}

// the error reads:
// objc[89748]: Cannot form weak reference to instance (0x600000c8a5e0) of class NSTextView. It is possible that this object was over-released, or is in the process of deallocation.
~~~

So, once again, we use an owned messenger:

~~~swift
class MyTextView: NSTextView {
   let messenger = Var<TextEvent>
}

let textView = MyTextView()

observe(textView.messenger) { textEventUpdate in
   // process event update
}
~~~

### 3. Inherit and Extend Observability

Consider this case: I have a generic class `Tree`. It is `Observable`, so tree nodes can observe their branches. Then I have an `Item` which derives from `Tree`. `Item` cannot extend or override the `Tree.UpdateType`.

In order to further specify what items can send to their observers, the `Tree` must use a nested messenger. This tree messenger should (somewhat redundantly) be named after its class: `treeMessenger`, so that there's no confusion in inheriting classes about which messenger belongs to which ancestor.
